# User Class with JUnit Tests

This project contains a `User` class with attributes such as `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and a list of favorite activities. The class also includes methods to get and set these attributes, check if a user has a specific favorite activity, and add new favorite activities. 

The project also includes a set of JUnit tests to validate the functionality of the `User` class methods.
